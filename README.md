# ESLint gone Markov

What if ESLint had an infinite number of rules?

[Live demo](http://justinas.github.io/eslint-markov/)

## FAQ

### What is this?
A Markov chain generator based on ESLint rule messages
with some added bells and whistles.

### Why?
Because I've been writing JavaScript for the past few weeks
and ESLint is now my best friend and my mortal enemy at the same time.

### How come your JS is so 2010?
Because I want it to work in a reasonable set of browsers.
Believe me, I too enjoy arrow functions and destructuring.

## Attribution

The set of lint rules were benevolently grep'ed out of ESLint
on February 24th, 2017.
[Check it out](https://github.com/eslint/eslint),
it's an awesome project.
